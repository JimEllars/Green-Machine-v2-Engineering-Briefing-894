# Edge Telemetry & Diagnostics Update

## Telemetry Endpoints
- **Edge Worker:** Both `/api/health` and `/api/telemetry` endpoints in the `thirdweb_bridge.ts` have been enhanced.
- They now return JSON telemetry capturing the Cloudflare region/colo via `request.cf.colo`, mock an uptime calculated from module startup, and determine cache hit ratios from tracked metrics.

## React Dashboard Diagnostics Hooks
- Replaced manual interval checks with a new robust `useSystemDiagnostics` custom hook that implements exponential backoff during outages.
- Merged DB check with the Edge check inside the single diagnostic polling effect, standardizing status to Healthy, Degraded, and Offline.
- In `MarketFeedMatrix.jsx` we now feature a forced manual resync button backed by `refetch()` and loading animation indicators.

## Auth Continuity
- Supabase token events no longer cause volatile side-effects. The `supabaseClient.js` was upgraded with an in-memory pub-sub cache that preserves `StrategyConsultantTerminal` state natively across tab re-visits and reconnects using `sessionStorage`.

## Non-Regression Compliance
- Ran ESLint, vite build, and wrangler TS compliance checks locally. Zero downtime or database structure modification introduced. Edge isolate is safely catching unmapped routes and JSON serialization issues through generic JSON 502 fallback objects.
